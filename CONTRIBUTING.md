## Phases
**0. Purpose and Aim of the Book** (insert: what is the TokenEngineering book, 2-3 sentences on the content) As published here since May 11, 2020,(don't get this, can we link the structure here?) is has an annotated table of contents, folders for chapters and collects references and core topics in each chapter; join TE Discord Channel #te-book for discussions and updates. 

**1. Early Access** starting from 20 June 2020; [show your support](https://tokengenie.org/), help fund bounties for code examples, illustrations, interviews; get access to early drafts as they are being written, raw-cuts of interviews, scribbles; comment and ask questions, decide on which chapters should be worked on first, get your NFT and direct its revenue share from edited book sales to your favorite OSS projects in the TE community. (Exciting! Great roadmap, have you already defined how this will work exactly?)You can also adapt and commercially use the edited version (like that you'll publish it under this license. However, this sound like you want to encourage other e.g. to publish and commercialize a print version themselves :) (see [licence](../master/LICENCE.md)). Early access ends 1-2 weeks before next phase.(This is not really clear - perhaps it makes sense to break down the phases and then refer to early access.) All co-/authors support through Early Access. 

**2. Presale** starts in September 2020 and mainly funds editing for print and marketing efforts, presale comes at a discount, and presale participants will receive excerpts until December 2020, when the book is ready to ship.

## Contributing here
You can start right away and across all phases and thereafter:
- For a quick fix: Clicking on "edit" when viewing a specific file, GitHub's UI will automatically fork and let you create a pull request
- More involved: fork --> clone locally --> make new branch naming it according to your add-on perspective --> make your changes --> push it back to your repo --> click the "compare [& pull request](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github)" 

If this is your [first time contributing](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) don't hesitate to also drop by the TE Discord channel of [#te-book](https://discord.gg/uZJkb6).
(missing: Will there be regular calls/team meetings to discuss edits? Who are other authors (might be relevant for contributors)? Who is going to make the final decision on a contribution? 

When a Chapter is deemed ready to exit Early Access (early access is a bit confusing here. in 1. it sounds like this is a special status for those who donate. I think it is worth breaking down separately a) if you contribute, you'll get a,b,c and b) how the book is going to be "developed" (seems pretty much like software development - awesome!), it gets an update in this public repository. Many chapters will benefit from an early exit, e.g. ones with examples, or references, which can be extended and improved upon in this repo. Substantial valuable input for a Chapter that goes into print editions can get you added as co-author, or acknowledged otherwise, e.g. in form of discounts on hard copies of the book. In any case contributors here earn [TE Creds](https://github.com/TokenEngineeringCommunity/AraCred). 

Join the [Early Access phase](https://tokengenie.org/) to put some skin in the game!

## Style
You get extra credits for making the content more fun, engaging, and visual.

References in a Chapter go to it's References.md in [APA Format](https://pitt.libguides.com/c.php?g=12108&p=64730)

Most of the sample code is in [Phyton in notebooks](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/templates/example_notebook.ipynb). Depending on how [Jupyter{Book}](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) evolves we might use it sometime from Early Access to Presale. As for code in any other language, e.g. Solidity, use [original style-guide](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/style-guide.html).
